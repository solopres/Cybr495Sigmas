# Medical Computer Systems
Considering the history of attacks against medical computer systems, data breaches seem to be a major issue within these systems.
Examples include the data breach and ransomware attack of Change Healthcare in 2024, Ascension in 2024, and HCA Healthcare in 2025.  

The automated attack framework will initially focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited to establish the exflitration of data.
As such, the main aim of this project is to identify vulnerabilities based on the tactics provided by MITRE ATT&CK that might allow for adversaries to exfiltrate data.
By focusing on these areas, This project hopes to make itself applicable to the medical field in assisting the prevention of future data breaches.

## Other Applications
While this project will be heavily focused on application for medical systems, due to the nature of its functionaility, it will likely be made an effective tool for testing other networks and systems outside the mdeical field.
