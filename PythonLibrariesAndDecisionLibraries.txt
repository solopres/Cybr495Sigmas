ADAPTIVE PYTHON PENTESTING FRAMEWORK
===========================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This project is a modular, adaptive penetration testing framework written in Python.
It is designed to assess intentionally vulnerable virtual machines in a controlled
lab environment.

The framework performs staged reconnaissance, service enumeration, and targeted
vulnerability testing. Tests are dynamically selected based on discovered services,
protocols, and software versions rather than running every test blindly.

This design reduces noise, improves efficiency, and more closely mirrors real-world
penetration testing workflows.


PROJECT GOALS
-------------
- Identify network and application vulnerabilities on controlled targets
- Dynamically adapt testing strategy based on discovered attack surface
- Demonstrate ethical, permission-based penetration testing practices
- Produce structured, professional reports for academic evaluation


ETHICAL AND LEGAL DISCLAIMER
----------------------------
This tool is strictly for educational use.

- Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- All testing is performed against locally hosted vulnerable virtual machines
- Unauthorized use against external systems is illegal and unethical

This project follows responsible disclosure and ethical hacking principles.


HOW THE FRAMEWORK WORKS
----------------------

1. RECONNAISSANCE
   - Identify live hosts
   - Enumerate open ports and running services
   - Detect service versions and protocols

2. ANALYSIS AND DECISION ENGINE
   - Map discovered services to applicable vulnerability tests
   - Skip irrelevant or incompatible tests
   - Prioritize high-risk findings

3. TARGETED TESTING
   - Network misconfiguration checks
   - Authentication weakness testing
   - Web application vulnerability checks
   - Protocol-specific security testing

4. REPORTING
   - Colored terminal output with severity levels
   - Structured JSON and CSV result exports
   - Optional PDF report generation

DYNAMIC TEST SELECTION
----------------------
The framework does not execute all tests on every target.

Instead:
- Open ports determine which protocol tests run
- Detected services determine applicable vulnerability checks
- Service versions influence severity and prioritization
- Web tests only run when HTTP or HTTPS is detected
- Authentication tests only run on exposed login services

This reduces unnecessary scanning and improves accuracy.


SUPPORTED TESTING AREAS
-----------------------
- TCP and UDP port scanning
- Service and version detection
- Weak authentication detection
- Web application vulnerability checks
- TLS and certificate misconfiguration testing
- DNS and network misconfiguration analysis


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Root or administrator privileges for packet-level testing
- Vulnerable virtual machines for testing

Example targets:
