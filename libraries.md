# Python Libraries
**json** - encode and decode objects JSON strings, javascript object notation is a lightweight, text-based format for storing and exchanging data. It is human-readable, easy to parse, and widely used for communication between servers and clients in web applications.  

**os** - module that provides a portable way for python to interact with the operating system. It includes functions for file and directory management, process handling, environment variable manipulation, and more.   

**subprocess** - allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.  

**logging** - python's built in event logging system, basically instead of print we’ll record structured events like what action was run, whether it succeeded, the errors and any state changes.  

**time** - library for sleeping, timestamps and measuring duration. Measure tech execution runtime most likely.   

**random** -  generates pseudo random choices, will help choose between multiple tech and simulate uncertainty, avoid deterministic behavior as much as possible.   

**networkx** - for creating and analyzing graphs, modeling hosts, users, services as nodes. Calculate paths and reachability.   

**rich** - good terminal output library, colored logs and tables and progress bars and tree views. Makes it easier to understand.   

**pydantic** - data validation library. Define data models, valid inputs, prevent bugs.
